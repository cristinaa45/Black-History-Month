She was born in February 1913 in Tuskegee, Alabama.Her parents were James and Leona McCauley, but both of Rosa's grandparents were enslaved people and strong advocates for racial equality.Rosa was educated at home by her mom, who worked as a teacher at a neabry school. When Rosa entered school she was in a class where the teacher was put in charge of 50 kids and more, the white children were bused to their schools but the black child had to walk. At the age of 11 Rosa entered Montgomery Industrial School for Girl,where only the black girls were taught regular school subjects and domestic skills.At the age of 16 she was forced to leave schools because of an illness in the family, and she started cleaning the houses of white people. On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks made history when riding the bus because there were white passengers standing in the aisle, they told Rosa to move but she refused. She was arrested and fined $10 for the "offense" and $4 for court cost, but neither of which she paid.  </p>
